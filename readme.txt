Add App Links to your website to make app-to-app linking possible

== Description ==

Right now, linking on mobile is a lot more frustrating and complicated than it is on the web. There isn’t an easy, consistent way to control what happens when someone clicks on your content in mobile, which makes it difficult to provide the best experience for your users. It’s also hard to find out when—and how—to send people out of your app and directly into another.

App Links is here to help with that. It’s an open, cross-platform solution for app-to-app linking that gives you the tools you need to expose deep links in your app or to link out to others.

App Links is free. It’s open source. It’s easy to implement. And it’s going to make mobile linking a whole lot easier for developers.
